- View panning works now just by mouse dragging, without pressing Control.
This feature is much better usable this way.

- Bug fixed: In the AVM tree view configurator, the LabelStyle editor
used to incorrectly set the text color when the alternative text
color was changed. [A problem with the tag labels surfaced in the process:
tags are initially displayed in their with normal color, regardless of state.]
