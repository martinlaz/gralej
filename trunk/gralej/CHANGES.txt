- Keyboard navigation in feature structures.
- The ability to display unbound variables (unbound tags sounds weird).
- Highlighting of substructures.
- Selection listeners.


Version 0.5.3

- View panning works now just by mouse dragging, without pressing Control.
This feature is much better usable this way.

- Bug fixed: In the AVM tree view configurator, the LabelStyle editor
used to incorrectly set the text color when the alternative text
color was changed. [A problem with the tag labels surfaced in the process:
tags are initially displayed in their with normal color, regardless of state.]
